/**
 * BackgroundProcessor takes care of tasks that (1) need to happen periodically to keep
 * Rust-Lightning running properly, and (2) either can or should be run in the background. Its
 * responsibilities are:
 * Monitoring whether the ChannelManager needs to be re-persisted to disk, and if so,
 * writing it to disk/backups by invoking the callback given to it at startup.
 * ChannelManager persistence should be done in the background.
 * Calling `ChannelManager::timer_tick_occurred()` and
 * `PeerManager::timer_tick_occurred()` every minute (can be done in the
 * background).
 * 
 * Note that if ChannelManager persistence fails and the persisted manager becomes out-of-date,
 * then there is a risk of channels force-closing on startup when the manager realizes it's
 * outdated. However, as long as `ChannelMonitor` backups are sound, no funds besides those used
 * for unilateral chain closure fees are at risk.
